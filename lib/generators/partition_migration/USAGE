    Generates a migration to create the upcoming required partitions, according to the app's configuration.
    Both the list of tables to be partitioned and the partitioning range depend are set in the application's initializers.

    bin/rails generate drop_partitions_migration

    This will create:
        db/migrate/TIMESTAMP_create_upcoming_partitions.rb
